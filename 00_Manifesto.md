# The Free Personal Stack Manifesto

## The Problem

Building apps shouldn't require:
- Credit cards
- Dashboard clicking
- Infrastructure expertise
- Monthly bills

Yet most "free" tiers are traps at the end of the day. 
There are some that are usable and others are just traps.

## The Values

### 1. Democratization of App Building

Anyone with an idea should be able to ship it. Not just developers with AWS accounts or teams with budgets.

This stack removes the gatekeepers:
- No credit card required
- No payment method needed
- No "upgrade to continue" messages
- Works for personal projects, side projects, experiments

### 2. Flow State, Not Context Switching

The enemy of building is leaving your IDE. Every dashboard click, every API key hunt, every "where do I configure this?" moment breaks flow.

This stack:
- Configure once with code
- Everything in version control
- No manual dashboard setup
- Deploy with `git push`

### 3. Free Means Free

Not "Free like for 14 days" or "free like with credit card" or "free like 0.00013 free."

Free means:

- Zero dollars
- No credit card
- No expiration
- Production-ready from day one
- Limits in volume.

### 4. Professional, Not Prototype

Free doesn't mean "good enough for demos." This stack gives you:

- HTTPS by default
- Custom domains
- Real databases
- Auto-scaling infrastructure
- Security best practices

## What This Is

A complete, production-ready stack that you can:

- Create from template in 1 minute
- Deploy in 30 minutes
- Run forever for free
- Scale to thousands of users

## What This Isn't

- A framework (it's infrastructure)
- A tutorial (it's a template)
- A compromise (it's the real thing)

## The Stack

- **Vercel**: Hosting (free tier: 100GB/month)
- **Supabase**: Database + Auth (free tier: 500MB DB)
- **Cloudflare**: DNS (free tier: unlimited)
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code (Don't worry you will not need to touch it)

All free. All production-ready. All configured in code.

## Who This Is For

- Developers who want to ship ideas fast
- Builders tired of vendor lock-in
- Anyone who believes apps should be accessible
- People who prefer code over clicks

## The Promise

Follow this guide and you'll have:
- A live app accessible from anywhere
- HTTPS and custom domain
- Real database with authentication
- Auto-deployments on every push
- Zero ongoing costs

**In under an hour. With zero dollars. No credit card.**
